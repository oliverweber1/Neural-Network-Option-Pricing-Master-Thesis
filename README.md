# Neural Network Approximations of European Option Prices in Exponential LÃ©vy Models

### Option Price Generation
- Simulations of stochastic processes (Brownian Motion, Compound Poisson Process, Jump Diffusion Process, NIG Process) are implemented in *StochasticProcesses.py* and *MultivariateProcesses.py*
- European option price calculation via Monte-Carlo simulation is implemented in *OptionPricing.py* for Black-Scholes, Merton Jump Diffusion and NIG models
- Analytic formulas for Black-Scholes and Merton Jump Diffusion prices are given in *AnalyticFormulas.py*
- Paths of the Poisson process, compound Poisson process, Merton Jump Diffusion model and NIG model are plotted in *PathPlots.ipynb*
- European (basket) call option prices are generated in *Option Price Generation.ipynb* and plotted in *Price Plots.ipynb*
